                        This is my cat Charlie. He's a dramatic king. Slay! His favourite activites include eating food, chewing random stuff in my room, and biting my fingers at 2 am. A famous incident of his is the 'olive oil incident', in which he spilled an entire bottle of olive oil on himself while looking for treats, then tracked pawprints all around the house. He was not very happy about the ensuing bath, haha.

                        This is my cat Callie. Her hobbies include licking the walls of the shower, sprinting around at full speed, and biting my hair.
                        A famous incident of Callie's is when my friend brought her kitten to my house, and Callie was so scared of it that when my brother (who she is very fond of) picked her up and started to take her back downstairs, she growled and hissed at him, which she never does.
